# Suppressing keyboard and mouse events

This code will block all mouse and keyboard actions until you press a key combination <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd>.

Personally, I use this code to prevent deleting something while cleaning up the mouse and keyboard.

# Executables:
You can build your own executables with [pyinstall](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).

Or use this one for Windows 10 (64 bit):
[WINDOWS_64_BIT](executables/Supress_input_WINDOWS_64_BIT.7z) - see check at [virustotal.com ](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7e937c1bebfd55eaa5612721f8cb57a59df3f1b0a5b139cfeafaf09792cf913e?nocache=1)
